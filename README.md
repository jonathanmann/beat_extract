# [Beat Extract](https://www.beatextract.com)

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a tool to isolate and extract a repeating beat from within an input music file. This project is currently under development and is not yet fully functional.

## Usage
To get a readout of the wave file you're working with, use the following syntax:
```bash
    $ ./freq_extract.py <wave file input>
```
You should see output that resembles the following screenshot:
